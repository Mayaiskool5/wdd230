              I choose this page as it demonstrates good use of color and contrast.
              While it's a simple idea at its core, showing the people working 
              in this Studio and what are their responsibilities, the execution with each 
              of them having a photo that matches the background color it's perfect. 
              <br>I think it directs your attention and makes you want to see all of the pictures
              on the website and most importantly create an instant connection with the people
              who work in this studio. 
              This is accomplished by the vibrant colors against a white background and the 
              great contrast that exists between them.

            <h2>Fitt's Law</h2>
            <h3>The McBride Company<br><a href="https://mcbridedesign.com/" target=”_blank”>https://mcbridedesign.com/</a></h3>
            <div class="scrolling-preview">
              <img src="images/Fitt's.jpg" width="100%" alt="Example of the Fitt's law">
            </div>
            <p>
              For me this is one of the best examples of the Fitt's principle,
              the website is for a company whose work ranges from Graphic Desing to Interior Desing
              passing through Architectural Desing, and they  have worked with big brands.
              <br>They could have included all this information on their main page, however they opted
              for 3 main options that encampulates their field of work. 
              <br>The three options are centered with the same font size, I think this is perfect to
              guide the user to one of three posibilites and then expand the options based on 
              their initial desire.

            <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
            <h3>PayPal<br><a href="http://paypal.com/" target=”_blank”>http://paypal.com/</a></h3>
            <div class="scrolling-preview">
              <img src="images/Hick's.jpg" width="100%" alt="Example of the Hick's law">
            </div>
            <p>
              I liked this site to exemplify Hick's Law, as soon as we open the page we are
              presented with two options at the top, the Menu and Log In options. 
              Then in the middle two arrows to know more about purchasing or selling online. 
              <br>Most likely the users comming to this page will want to access their account 
              and make an online transaction. While new commers to the platform can check 
              the Menu options or the arrows and see all the posibilites the platform can present 
              and know more about the service given by this company.
