                The Junior Suite. 
                Junior suites are smaller than a regular suite but more importantly, 
                typically don't have a solid separation between the bedrooms and living area. 
                These suites have small living areas that are an extension of the bedroom space 
                and don't come with dining areas. The good part of junior suites is that they're 
                priced lower than regular suites and often have sofa beds so you can accommodate 
                more guests.

                The Residential Suite. 
                These are fully furnished suites in every sense of the word. 
                Not only do you get a separate living room, dining room and one or 
                more bathrooms, some suites also come with wet bars, fully stocked kitchens, 
                in-suite washer dryer units, and even patios and terraces.

                The Presidential Suite. 
                The absolute best suite in any hotel. 
                Most hotels would usually carry only a few presidential or penthouse suites. 
                Typically housed on the top floors, this is your ultra-lavish-architecture-digest-fancy-af 
                suite with everything you can think of. Fabulous panoramic views, high-end toiletries, 
                jetted tubs in bathrooms that look like spas, expansive living, dining and bedroom areas, 
                entry foyers, private terraces and sometimes even private butlers!

              <h2 class="miss-headline-4">Connecting Suite</h2>
              <p class="miss-paragraph-4">
                The Connecting Suite. 
                Available only on Suiteness, connecting suites are suite configurations 
                where more than one bedroom is connected to the living area of a suite. 
                Some of these also feature one suite that connects to another suite. 
                You see, most hotel suites are built with an attached room or suite that 
                has a separate private entrance. Sadly, hotel reservation systems are 
                outdated. So while these suites and rooms are attached,
                they can only be sold separately and never together as a connecting suite. 
                Until now, that is. A connecting suite is essentially the same as a 
                regular full-sized suite that has more than one attached bedroom - only, 
                less expensive. You're looking at anywhere between a $100 to even $1,000 
                difference between a regular two-bedroom suite and a connecting two-bedroom 
                suite. See what staying in a connecting suite is like with this virtual tour.
